# Contributions

#### Your contributions are always welcome!

Contribution Best Practices:
- Write clear meaningful git commit messages.
- **Follow PEP8 coding style. There are tons of packages (Sublime Text 3, VS Code, or any other good editor).**
- Write tests wherever necessary.
- Stricly follow the PR Template appended at the end of the document.
- When you make very minor changes to a PR of yours make sure you squash your commits afterward so that you don't have an absurd number of commits for a very small fix.
